Babua LMS – Idea

Content is already free.
The real problem is no planning and no revision.

So instead of building another LMS that sells courses, I focused on two things only:

Helping students plan realistically before they start

Helping them not forget what they study

Learning stays 100% free.
Any paid part is optional and only for accountability or time-saving insights, never for accessing knowledge.

Due to limited time, I focused on idea and approach, not implementation.

The goal is simple:
Don’t teach more. Help students forget less.

# Babua LMS – Idea & Approach

Learning content today is already free.  
The real problem is that students **start without a plan** and **forget whatever they study**.

So instead of building another LMS that sells courses, this project focuses on **two core ideas**:

## 1. Plan Before You Start
Students should clearly know:
- How much time they can give
- How long the journey will take
- Whether their goal is realistic

Planning should be **simple and free**, not a paid feature.

## 2. Don’t Forget After You Learn
In DSA, finishing lectures means nothing if concepts are forgotten later.

This approach treats forgetting as a system problem and focuses on:
- Problem-first revision
- Structured recall
- Retention over completion

## Babua Philosophy
- Learning stays **100% free**
- No locked content
- No certificate-driven value
- Paid features (if any) are optional and only for accountability or time-saving insights

## Note
Due to limited time, the focus was on **ideation and approach**, not implementation.

**Goal:**  
> Don’t teach more. Help students forget less.
